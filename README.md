# Perl RDF experiments from Biohackathon 2010 (and beyond)

In February 2010, a bunch of fellow bioinformatics/semantic web geeks
came together in Tokyo for the
[third Biohackathon](http://hackathon3.dbcls.jp/wiki) to hack on all
things RDF, SPARQL & co for bioinformatics.

This repository is meant to be a simple starting point to collect code
and documents for the Perl people at the Biohackathon, and to keep
working on exploring and improving the use of Perl for semantic web
stuff after hackathon.
